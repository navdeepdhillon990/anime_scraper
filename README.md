# ANIME SCRAPER COMPENDIUM
 Currently two seperate scripts that fetch titles/magnets from Nyaa or Erai-Raws

 Erai script is fully functional and includes the following:
 # Goes through list of keywords to find matching anime that aired
 # If did air, checks directory to see if episode doesnt already exists
 # Downloads all episodes that dont exist
 
 Additional Functions to add:
 # Only check anime with the NEW tag, or that aired TODAY (Could be done by comparing release time/date)
 
 Scraper for Nyaa is incomplete and will grab anything that matches the keyword on the first page

 Further functionality to be added with SubsPlease...?
