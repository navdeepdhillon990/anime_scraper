# ANIME SCRAPER COMPENDIUM
 Currently two seperate scripts that fetch titles/magnets from Nyaa or Erai-Raws

 Erai script is fully functional and includes the following:
 # Goes through list of keywords to find matching anime that aired
 # If did air, checks directory to see if episode doesnt already exists
 # Downloads all episodes that dont exist
 # Fetches "Today" tags and puts in its own array to see if anime aired today
 
 Scraper for Nyaa is incomplete and will grab anything that matches the keyword on the first page

 Further functionality to be added with SubsPlease...?
