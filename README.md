# ANIME SCRAPER COMPENDIUM
 Currently two seperate scripts that fetch titles/magnets from Nyaa or Erai-Raws

 Anime Episode Scraper
 Richter / Deepak
 
 Usage: Enter keywords for anime title in anime_titles array
 Can scrap Nyaa and Erai Raws based on keywords entered

 Scraper for Nyaa is incomplete and will grab anything that matches the keyword on the first page

 Erai-Raws is a bit more reliable with more options and checks directory to see if episode already exists before downloading etc

 Further functionality to be added with SubsPlease
